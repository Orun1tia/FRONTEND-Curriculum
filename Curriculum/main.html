      <p class="about">As a university student, I see myself as proactive and passionate about continuous learning. My
        profile is characterized by a strong ability to solve problems and adapt to new situations, skills that I have
        honed throughout my academic journey. I stand out for my positive attitude towards challenges and my capability to
        collaborate effectively in multidisciplinary teams. Among my strengths is my efficient time management, which
        allows me to balance studies, projects, and extracurricular activities. Additionally, I have a deep interest in
        research, leading me to constantly explore new areas of knowledge and stay updated with the latest trends in my
        field. My ability to communicate ideas clearly and effectively is also a significant asset, facilitating
        interactions with peers, professors, and professionals. My goal is to leverage these competencies to make
        meaningful contributions in a professional environment, tackling challenges with enthusiasm and dedication, and
        supporting both personal and team growth.</p>
